Assumptions: 
- As I was using the in-memory-web-api, I needed a way to provide a primary key, so I have added "id" as per the tutorials found on the web.

Challenges:
- Most of my issues came during CSS, placing the widgets correctly, 
choosing right colors.
- Understanding what is router-outlet and how child components works.
